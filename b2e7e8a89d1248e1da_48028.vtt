You see,
my uncle Francis was born

04:44.535 --> 04:47.169
with too much
water in his lungs.

04:47.171 --> 04:49.372
They say the doctors
swung Francis around

04:49.374 --> 04:51.707
by the ankles to
clear the water out...

04:51.709 --> 04:54.510
and that's what gave him
the huge chest
and skinny legs...

04:54.512 --> 04:56.445
that made him
such a great swimmer.
